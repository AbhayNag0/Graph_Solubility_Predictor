# Graph Solubility Predictor
This model takes in a smiles string and outputs the solubility of the molecule using a Graph Neural Network

The jupyter notebook GNN_Sol_Predictor.ipynb was built to run on google colab. If running locally, install the following dependencies.

1. Pytorch
2. Seaborn

Deepchem and Pytorch geometric are installed in the notebook itself.
